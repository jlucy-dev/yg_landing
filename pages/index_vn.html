            <p class="policy_text">
            <h4>Purpose of Collection and Use of Personal Information</h4><br />
            <p class="policy_text">"Personal information" means the information that enables to identify a specific
              person by name, identification number, etc. as the information about a living person (including
              information that enables to identify by combining easily with other information even if it alone cannot
              identify a specific individual).
              The “Corporation” may use some services at any time without separate registration as a user. However,
              the “Corporation” collects personal information of users in order to provide better quality services
              including customized services to users through member services.
              The "Corporation" does not disclose user’s personal information without his/her prior consent, and the
              collected information is used as follows:</p><br />
            <p class="policy_text">First, we can develop more useful services on the basis of personal information
              provided by users. When developing new services or expanding contents, the “Corporation” sets the
              priority of the services to be developed more efficiently on the basis of the personal information
              provided by existing users and the “Corporation” may reasonably selects and provides the contents that
              users need.
            </p><br />
            <p class="policy_text">Second, most of the information and services provided by the “Corporation” are free
              of charge. The “Corporation” may post advertisements to provide these free services; however,
              advertisements and contents will be appropriately delivered through each service or menu to users on the
              basis of accurate personal information of users, which will ultimately have a value as another piece of
              information that the “Corporation” provides to users. The “Corporation” receives advertisements from
              advertisers and only exposes the advertisements to the type of users the advertisers want to target, and
              never shows or provides personal information of users to advertisers.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="policy_text">
              Third, the purpose of collecting information is as follows:</p>
            <ol class="policy_list">
              <li>Name, Resident Registration No., Identification No., Password: Identification for use of service

            </p>
            <p class="policy_text">
            <h4>Items and Collection Methods of Personal Information </h4><br />
            <p class="policy_text">When a user signs up as a member to use the member service, the “Corporation”

            </p>

            <p class="policy_text">

              collected personal information is completely deleted from the hard disk in a non-reproducible way and is
              processed not to be viewed or used for any purpose.</p>
            <br />
            <ol class="policy_list">
              <li>Member Registration Information: In the event of withdrawal or removal from membership, the
                “Corporation” must obtain consent by the “Member” for a specific matter, specifying the purpose of

            <p class="policy_text">
            <h4>Sharing and Provision of Personal Information</h4>
            <p class="policy_text">In principle, the "Corporation" does not disclose a user's personal information to
              other people, companies or institutions. However, the following cases are exceptions:</p>
            <br />
            <ol class="policy_list">

                public morals; or</li>
              <li> In case that there are sufficient grounds to consider that it is required to disclose personal
                information in order to take legal measures.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p class="policy_text">
            <h4>Safety Measures for Protection of Personal Information</h4>
            <p class="policy_text">A Member's personal information is basically protected by ID(unique number) and
              password(password), and all management of and responsibility for the ID(unique number) and
              password(password) given to a “Member” are the responsibility of the “Member”. Therefore, a “Member”
              shall close all activated browser windows after using the “Service”. In particular, if a “Member” shares
              a PC with other people or uses it in a public place (company, school, library, internet game room,
              etc.), the above procedure is more necessary to be takenin order to prevent personal information from
              being disclosed to others.
            </p>
            </p>

            <p class="policy_text">
            <h4>Management (viewing, changing, deletion) of Customer’s Own Personal Information</h4>
            <p class="policy_text">A “Member” may view or revise his/her registered personal information at any time,
              and may request withdrawal of membership. Viewing and revising of Member's personal information can be
              done in the “Member Information Management” of the "Corporation".
              However, in the case of changing the member’s information, ID(unique number), name and resident
              registration No. can not be changed according to the real name policy for “Members” and even though that
              is the case, if the “Member” wants to change, he/she must re-register.</p>
            </p>

            <p class="policy_text">
            <h4>Matters of Cookie Operation</h4>
            <p class="policy_text">In order to provide customized services to users, the “Corporation” is using
              'Cookies' to store and retrieve user information occasionally. ‘Cookie’ is a small amount of information
              sent to the user's computer browser by the server(HTTP) used to operate the website, and it can be
              stored in the hard disk of the user's personal computer.
            </p><br />
            <p class="policy_text">A user must allow ‘Cookies’ by log-in after accessing the “Site” of "Corporation"
              to use the member service and other services. The “Corporation” uses the ‘Cookie’ to find ID
              information, in order to provide suitable and more useful services to the users. ‘Cookie’ can identify a
              user’s computer, but does not identify the user personally.
            </p><br />
            <p class="policy_text">By using the ‘Cookie’, the “Corporation” can create and provide more convenient
              services by identifying the types of visit and use of each service and website of the “Corporation”,
              popular search terms, and the size of users, and provide optimized information to users. A user can
              choose whether to use ‘Cookie’ or not. By setting options in the web browser, a user may allow all of
              the Cookies or confirm whenever ‘Cookie’ is saved, or refuse to save any of the ‘Cookie’. However, in
              case that a user refuses to save “Cookie’, you may not be able to use some of the Services of the
              “Corporation” that require to log in.

              the “Corporation” shall take necessary measures immediately. </p>
            </p>
            <p class="policy_text">
            <h4>Responsibility for Links</h4>
            <p class="policy_text">The website of “Corporation” contains various banners and links. In many cases, it
              is linked to the pages of other sites, and this is a measure to reveal the source of the content
              provided by or the contractual relationship with the advertiser.
              If a user clicks the link included in the website of the “Corporation” and moves to the page of another
              site, this “Personal Information Handling Policy” does not apply to the act of collecting personal
              information on that site.
